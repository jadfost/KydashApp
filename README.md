# Flask + Vercel

This example shows how to use Flask 3 on Vercel with Serverless Functions using the [Python Runtime](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/functions/serverless-functions/runtimes/python).

## Demo

https://flask3-python-template.vercel.app/](https://dashboardpy.vercel.app/

## How it Works

This example uses the Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI) with Flask to enable handling requests on Vercel with Serverless Functions.

## Running Locally

```bash
npm i -g vercel
vercel dev
```

Your Flask application is now available at `http://localhost:3000`.
